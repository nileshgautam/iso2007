					<p class="text-justify">
						Use this tool to record and track your progress as you implement the mandatory and discretionary clauses of ISO 27001.
					</p>
					<p class="text-justify">The main body of ISO 27001 specifies a number of mandatory requirements that you must fulfil for your information security management system (ISMS) to be certified as complying with the standard. The mandatory requirements for certification concern the management system rather than the information security controls. For example, the standard requires you to determine your organisation's information security risks, assess them, decide how you'll treat those risks, treat them and monitor them, using the policies and procedures defined in the ISMS. It does not make it compulsory for you to apply specific security controls.
					</p>
					<p class="text-justify">However, Annex A to ISO 27001 outlines a set of information security controls that your management system would typically be used to manage, provided they apply to your organisation. The security controls in Annex A are explained in much more detail in ISO 27002, and in various other standards, laws, regulations etc.

								<li style="padding-left:1em">Design and implement your ISMS so it complies with all the mandatory requirements set out in the main body of ISO 27001. Use the drop-down selectors in the 'Status' column of the 'Mandatory ISMS requirements' tab of this document to track and record your progress.</li>
							</p>
							<p>
								<li style="padding-left:1em">Identify and assess the information security risks that face those parts of your organisation you've included in your scope. Use the drop-down selectors in the 'Status' column of the 'Annex A controls' tab to identify any Annex A controls that do not apply to your organisation. Note: Do not feel constrained by Annex A! Adapt the sheet, change the wording and add additional rows if you decide you need other security controls to treat your information security risks and obligations (e.g. ISO 22301, privacy laws, PCI-DSS etc.). Annex A is merely a guide, a starting point.</li>
							</p>
							<p>
								<li style="padding-left:1em">Systematically check and record your progress in implementing your security controls, and update the 'Status' column of the 'Annex A controls' tab as necessary.
								</li>
							</p>
							<p>
								<li style="padding-left:1em">Once your ISMS is operating normally, and you have amassed sufficient evidence ("records"), it can be formally audited for compliance with 27001 by an accredited certification body. They will check that your ISMS fulfils the standard's mandatory requirements, and that your information security risks are being identified, treated and monitored according to the policies and procedures of your ISMS. From that point on, you should both maintain (i.e. update it when the information security risks or controls change) and periodically review this spreadsheet.
